As one of several moderators in a discord server, we have been looking for a ticketing system bot to allow members to have a private conversation with all moderators to avoid needing members to private message us, and possibly run into problems with availability, time-zones, and other issues. We haven't found any decent solutions that we liked, so here is my implementation of a discord bot ticketing system for moderators.

# Roadmap of features to come:
- Clickable button interface to create a ticket
- Automatic create of a private channel with members of the moderator team and the user who opened the ticket
- Automatic welcome message with instructions for the user
- Command to close the ticket when finished
- Button to close the ticket when finished (?)
- Exporting of the conversation occurring within the ticket to both a custom moderator-visible only logs channel *and* to the user's DMs in order for both parties to have a record
- A nontechnical friendly setup process for the bot involving only a few commands

## Lower Priority features:
- Support for tickets to involve more than 1 user if there are issues between a group of people
- Customization of logging channel
- Utilizing private threads instead of private channels in servers that are boosted in order to reduce channel clutter

# How to Use this bot in your server:
Coming Soon :)
